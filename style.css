/*
$0.32
	» Added the flexibility to allow developers to override the template_directory and template_directory_uri constants so as to allow flexibility of creating a parent theme out of convertica.
	» Updated the value for constants that define Hybrid core path for inclusion later, so as to be able to be used in case when a parent theme is being developed with convertica as a drop-in library.
$0.31
	» Fixed jQuery issue caused by 'chosen' script which was being enqueued on all admin pages instead of being enqueued only on the theme settings page.
	» Fixed the PHP strict standards error which would generate if a user tries to import settings by uploading a file with unsupported format or would not upload a file at all.
$0.30
	» Convertica settings now have validation / sanitization in place to make sure that the valid data is saved to database.
	» Landing sections content is now saved into database with the html entities encoded.
	@ TO-DOs @
		=> Reset settings should show a confirmation dialog before reset.
$0.29
	» Added Import / Export page under Appearance menu to allow users to export and import the theme settings. Import / Export feature is available via 'convertica-import-export' theme support.
$0.28
	--- # Development taken over by Aniket. # ---
	» Refactored theme admin page build. The theme settings are now registered on 'admin_init' which is more suitable than using admin_menu being used previously.
	» Added Reset Settings button to settings page to allow users to revert the settings to defaults.
	» Added theme support declaration 'convertica-settings-page' to allow admin page to be added only if the theme supports it.
	» Added filter 'convertica_settings_defaults' to allow users / devs to filter the default settings for the theme.
	» Reorganized the file structure to organize all admin functions into '../dev/convertica/admin' directory.
	» Added a body class to settings page that will be equal to the slug of the settings page.
	» Added a check to skip declaring 'Mobile_Detect' class if it aleady exists.
	» Added 'scripts()' and 'styles()' methods to available on all admin pages that are created by extending the 'Convertica_Settings_Base' class so that custom scripts and styles enqueued to that specific page.
	» Relocated the 'chosen' scripts library to be available in the '../dev/edge/scripts/chosen' directory so as to better organize the scripts location directory. Initially, it was located under the '../dev/edge/fonts/' directory.
	» Moved the convertica_get_prefix() function from '../dev/convertica/hc-functions.php' to '../dev/convertica/functions.php' since it was the only function that existed in that file; all other theme functions were declared in the latter file.
