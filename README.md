# Convertica
A solid base theme powered by Hybrid Core 3.0 that I use to build and deliver customer-websites.


Purpose:
-------

Convertica is for me. The name comes from “conversion” and Convertica’s
primary aim is to allow building sites that convert.

This can be SEO, landing-page-experience, easy customisation (for
developers) to re-architect a website for different purposes, etc.

I build websites for entrepreneurs and small businesses. Out of all the
theme frameworks out there, most are a dependency for the sites that I
build. I have to buy them for a client since some are proprietary;
others discourage redistribution even though they are open source.

Here’s my own base framework (think ‘skeleton’) that I can use as a base
to build websites around, thanks to Hybrid Core that neatly sits inside
the theme and is the engine behind Convertica.
